###  Legal Terms and Acknowledgements  

*Sorobanathon:Equinox* is governed by the SDF [Terms of Service](https://www.stellar.org/terms-of-service?locale=en) and the guidelines described herein (the ‚ÄúSorobanathon Eligibility Guidelines‚Äù). SDF may collect personal information from you in connection with your submission, and such information is subject to the SDF [Privacy Policy](https://www.stellar.org/privacy-policy?locale=en). SDF reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to cancel, suspend and/or modify all or any part of *Sorobanathon: Equinox* at any time for any reason. The terms and conditions of *Sorobanathon:Equinox* are subject to change at any time, including the rights or obligations of the Participants and SDF.

XLM is a highly risky and volatile asset, and SDF does not provide any representations, warranties, or guarantees of its value. You will be required to provide certain information to facilitate receipt of any XLM reward, including completing and submitting any tax or other forms necessary for compliance with applicable withholding and reporting requirements. You are responsible for reporting the receipt of any XLM reward to relevant government departments or agencies, where applicable, and paying all applicable taxes in your jurisdiction of residence. SDF reserves the right to withhold a portion of any reward amount to comply with the tax laws of the United States or other relevant jurisdictions. You should inform yourself as to any legal and tax requirements or consequences applicable to you in respect of the acquisition, holding, and disposition of XLM. You are also responsible for complying with any applicable foreign exchange and banking regulations relating to any XLM reward received hereunder.  

SDF‚Äôs failure to enforce any of these terms or guidelines shall not constitute a waiver of that provision. Should any provision of these Sorobanathon Eligibility Guidelines be or become illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction whose laws or regulations may apply to a participant or submission, such illegality or unenforceability shall leave the remainder of these Sorobanathon Eligibility Guidelines to the fullest extent permitted by law, unaffected and valid. The illegal or unenforceable provision shall be replaced by a valid and enforceable provision that comes closest and best reflects the SDF‚Äôs intention in a legal and enforceable manner with respect to the invalid or unenforceable provision.
