# Welcome to Sorobonathon: First Light

  

Between now and December 15, 2022, you can earn rewards for experimenting with Soroban, and sharing your experience by creating content of all kinds, big and small. This is your chance to be an early Soroban adopter, and to be a part of the first program funded by the [$100M][Soroban Adoption Fund]. Many more programs will follow! To find out about them, make sure to [join the Stellar Dev Discord](https://discord.gg/sp8zfb4qH6), and keep an eye on the #soroban channel.2

  

The goal right now is to get you started, to gather feedback to guide the continued development of Soroban, and to generate some content to help kickstart the Soroban ecosystem. So roll up your sleeves, experiment, and have some fun!

  

For each submission you create, you can earn a reward of [$25-300 in USDC]. It's a fun, low-lift way to tinker with Soroban while you help shape its development, and help grow the ecosystem as a whole.

## Here's the kind of submission we're looking for:

-   Code examples (think [Solidity by Example](https://solidity-by-example.org/))
    
-   Practical tutorials (such as this [DAO tutorial](https://docs.near.org/develop/relevant-contracts/dao))
    
-   Fun dapp tutorials (such as this [adoption tracking system for a pet shop](https://trufflesuite.com/blog/learn-ethereum-the-fun-way-with-our-pet-shop-tutorial/))
    
-   Soroban for X developer tutorials (X being another smart contracts platform such as Ethereum, Near, Solana, etc)
    
-   Video walkthroughs (such as this one on [creating a simple smart contract using Solidity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNXJNeaYl8Q))
    
-   Issues and feature requests (Check out the current [Soroban CLI issues](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-cli/issues), [Soroban environment issues](https://github.com/stellar/rs-soroban-env/issues), and [Soroban SDK issues](https://github.com/stellar/rs-soroban-sdk/issues).)
    
-   Key point: if you try something and it doesn't work, file a good issue, document your experience. That's one of the most valuable things you can do…

## What makes a good submission

SDF will review submissions as they come in, and rewards are contingent upon approval.

  

Your submission should be coherent, and easy to follow. If you are writing code, the code needs to work.If your code is not working, document why that is.If you are creating a tutorial, the audience needs to be able to follow along. If you are flagging an issue or making a feature request, it should be clear, complete, and helpful to the Soroban development team.

  

That said, we don't require submissions to be long, or involved, or super polished. You don't need to be a professional writer to participate, and we want to reward efforts big and small. If you have questions, feel free to reach out on the [Stellar Dev Discord](https://discord.gg/sp8zfb4qH6) in the #soroban channel.

Rewards will be based on the scope and complexity of the submission. That said, here is a rough idea of what certain types of submissions can earn.

-   Code examples $25-75
    
-   Issues and feature requests $25-50
    
-   Long-form written tutorials (how-tos, explainers) $100-300
    
-   Technical video tutorials $100-300
    

Note: SDF is under no obligation to make any rewards if there are no eligible submissions or eligible Participants, or if Participants do not successfully complete the compliance and tax obligations.

-   If you have, we will ask you to complete a form posted on your discussion thread to collect info necessary to send you your reward.
    
-   If your submission did not qualify, we will provide you with feedback on what's missing, or on how you can improve your submission so it qualifies. Once you have made the requested revisions, we will re-review your submission, and let you know if you qualify for a reward.
    

## Tips for picking something to work on

Choose a great hack idea.

-   Picture yourself at a hackathon trying to solve a problem quickly. What would it be?
    
-   Think about your own life and your own interests. Is there something missing that you could build with Soroban?
    
-   In this case, you can go big, and build the whole house, or you can scope things down, and focus on a single brick.
    

Look for inspiration

-   You don't need a completely unique concept, and reviewing other approaches can jumpstart your thought process
    
-   So check out existing smart contract tutorials. .
    
-   There's a lot of great prior art out there! Take advantage of it!
    

Connect with the community

-   Be proactive, engage with other devs, and ask for feedback in the [Stellar Dev Discord](https://discord.gg/UxsRyqpyBn) #soroban channel.

Remember to have fun!

-   There are no wrong answers here. As long as you are experimenting with Soroban, documenting and sharing, you're on the right track. .
    

Happy Soroban-ing!!
