# Welcome to *Sorobanathon: First Light* üî≠

Between now and December 15, 2022, you can earn rewards for experimenting with Soroban, and sharing your experience by creating content of all kinds, big and small. This is your chance to be an early Soroban adopter, and to be a part of the first program funded by the $100M Soroban Adoption Fund. Many more programs will follow! To find out about them, make sure to [join the Stellar Dev Discord](https://discord.gg/sp8zfb4qH6), and keep an eye on the #soroban channel.

  

The goal right now is to get you started, to gather feedback to guide the continued development of Soroban, and to generate some content to help kickstart the Soroban ecosystem. So roll up your sleeves, experiment, and have some fun!

  

For each qualified submission you create, you can earn a reward of 250 - 3000 XLM. It's a fun, low-lift way to tinker with Soroban while you help shape its development, and help grow the ecosystem as a whole.

## Here's the kind of submissions we're looking for:

-   Code examples (think [Solidity by Example](https://solidity-by-example.org/)) 
-   Practical tutorials (such as this [DAO tutorial](https://docs.near.org/develop/relevant-contracts/dao))    
-   Fun dapp tutorials (such as this [adoption tracking system for a pet shop](https://trufflesuite.com/blog/learn-ethereum-the-fun-way-with-our-pet-shop-tutorial/))    
-   Video walkthroughs (such as this one on [creating a simple smart contract using Solidity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNXJNeaYl8Q))   
-   Soroban for X developer tutorials (X = another smart contracts platform, such as Ethereum, Near, or Solana)

Also, if you're trying to do something and it doesn't work, let us know! File a good issue and/or document your experience in some way, and turn that in! Soroban is still a work in progress, and info about issues, bugs, and blockers is super useful right now.

  

You can file new issues (and see existing issues) in the [Soroban CLI repo](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-cli/issues) or the [Soroban SDK repo.](https://github.com/stellar/rs-soroban-sdk/issues) If you do file an issue, make sure to link to it in your *Sorobanathon: First Light* submission. If you have questions, feel free to ask them in the [Stellar Dev Discord](https://discord.gg/sp8zfb4qH6) #soroban channel

## What makes a good submission

The Stellar Development Foundation (‚ÄúSDF‚Äù) will review submissions as they come in, and all *Sorobanathon: First Light* rewards are contingent upon review and approval of the submission by SDF, in its sole discretion.

Your submission should be coherent and easy to follow. If you are creating a tutorial, the audience needs to be able to follow along. If you are writing code, it should be clear what the code is supposed to do. Ideally, the code works, but if it doesn't, capture any errors you encounter. If you create an issue or make a feature request, make sure it's clear, complete, and helpful. Please document everything you can!

That said, we don't require submissions to be long, or involved, or super polished. You don't need to be a professional writer to participate, and we want to reward efforts big and small. If you have questions, feel free to reach out on the [Stellar Dev Discord](https://discord.gg/sp8zfb4qH6) in the #soroban channel.

Rewards will be based on the scope and complexity of the submission. That said, here is a rough idea of what certain types of submissions can earn.

-   Code examples 250-750 XLM
-   Issues and feature requests 250-500 XLM
-   Long-form written tutorials (how-tos, explainers) 1000-3000 XLM    
-   Long-form technical video tutorials 1000-3000 XLM
    

Note: SDF is under no obligation to make any rewards if there are no eligible submissions or Eligible Individuals (as defined below), or if Eligible Individuals do not successfully complete the compliance and tax obligations set forth below.

## Get Started

If you haven't already, check out the [Soroban docs](https://soroban.stellar.org/docs) to get oriented, get set up, and get your head around the Soroban fundamentals. When you're ready to create a submission‚Ä¶

-   Click the "Discussions" tab at the top of the page    
-   Create a "New Discussion"    
-   Title your discussion thread    
-   Github Discussions requires you to search for similar discussion threads before creating a new thread. It's a good idea! That way, you can see submissions that have already been turned in. Don't copy from any, but feel free to create something similar. Use your brain!    
-   When you're ready, check off ‚ÄúI have done a search for similar discussions.‚Äù    
-   Add your submission. Feel free to put it right in the box, or to link to an external resource.    
-   Once you have posted, you're done!

We will review your submission within a week, and reply on your submission thread to let you know if your submission qualifies to earn a reward! If so, we will ask you to complete a form to collect info necessary to validate and deliver a reward.

If your submission did not qualify, we may provide you with feedback on what's missing, or on how you can improve your submission so it qualifies. Once you have made the requested revisions, we will re-review your submission, and let you know if your submission qualifies for a reward.

## Tips for picking submission topics

üí° Choose a great hack idea.
-   Picture yourself at a hackathon trying to solve a problem quickly. What would it be?    
-   Think about your own life and your own interests. Is there something missing that you could build with Soroban?    
-   In this case, you can go big, and build the whole house, or you can scope things down, and focus on a single brick. 

üîé Look for inspiration
-   You don't need a completely unique concept, and reviewing other approaches can jumpstart your thought process   
-   So check out existing smart contract tutorials for inspiration.

üåé Connect with the community
-   Be proactive, engage with other devs, and ask for feedback in the [Stellar Dev Discord](https://discord.gg/UxsRyqpyBn) #soroban channel.    
-   Remember that this is a community we build together üí™! Our code of conduct is [here](https://www.stellar.org/community/code-of-conduct).

üéâ Remember to have fun!
-   There are no wrong answers here. As long as you are experimenting with Soroban, documenting and sharing, you're on the right track.

**Happy Soroban-ing!!**
